## Front-end developer

# Zeynaddin Zralov

I am highly motivated to start my career as a Frontend Web Developer. As a proof of my motivation, I can metion the fact that I have gained confidence and experience by working on below mentioned projects using GitBash, HTML5, CSS3, SASS and JavaScript in the period of less than 4 months. I am currently in the process of exploring JavaScrips and ReactJS, after which I am determined to continue learning frameworks/libraries and improve my professional skills. I am aware that these are only beginnig knowledge and must-have technologies for a Frontend Web Developer. Currently, I would be glad to start my career in this sphere as a junior Frontend Web Developer.
